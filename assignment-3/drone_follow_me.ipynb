Fintetuning involves using the pretrained model and training it further using images of cyclists from a training dataset such as [VisDrone](https://github.com/VisDrone/VisDrone-Dataset). At the same time,  reducing the number of classes to a much smaller number such as person & bicycle may help.  Also some 2 stage detectors may need to be further optimized in terms of parameters for small objects. See [this paper](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/15/6887) for ideas around small object tracking.\n",
