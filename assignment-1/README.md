# Assignment 1

Date of submission: 2/11/2024

Instructions on how to run the code:

Code was written and run in Colab, can also be run locally in a Jupyter Notebook environment. Dependencies: Python 3.10.12, numpy 1.23.5, matplotlib 3.7.1, scipy 1.11.4

IMPORTANT NOTE: the Github display seems to be removing all line breaks in the code cells for some reason, but code displays and runs fine when downloaded and run in local environment. I tried multiple fixes, including copy and pasting into a new notebook as well as manually deleting and replacing linebreaks, but can't for the life of me figure out why Github decided not to display my linebreaks. The file is perfectly fine when downloaded, so this seems to be a Github specific problem, not Git, and the bug affects both Firefox and Safari. I confirmed with Aditya that he can successfully download and run the code despite the bug. Apologies for the inconvenience
