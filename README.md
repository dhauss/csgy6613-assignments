[Assignment 1](assignment-1): An exercise in Gaussian probability and Linear Algebra

[Assignment 2](assignment-2): Here I use a pretrained object detector to design and train an autoencoder. I use the small vector embeddings from the autoencoder to populate a vector database, allowing for NN similarity queries based on the cropped images of detected and autoencoded objects. See [Assignment 2 folder](assignment-2) for more details.

[Assignment 3](assignment-3): Here I use the VisDrone dataset to train a YOLOv8 model to recognize cars and bicyclists. I then use a Kalman filter to predict the trajectories of the target car and bicyclist in each video. See [Assignment 3 folder](assignment-3) for more details
